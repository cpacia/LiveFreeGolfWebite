		"excerpt": "Congrats to Jim Tokanel on taking top honors. Looking at the scorecard he played some great golf with just a few blunders toward the end of each side. It's great to see Jim playing well again, he has been battling some injuries and adversity so always nice to see him back on the top of the leaderboard. Jim was able to muster up a 77/69 round on way to victory. Also the only player who was able to shoot a sub 80 gross round."
